# M08W20 - Unit & Integration Testing

### To Do

- [ ] Tools for testing React
- [ ] Coverage Reports
- [ ] Add Features/Test to our Apps
- [ ] `debug()` and `prettyDom()`
- [ ] Mock AJAX Requests and Functions

### Types of testing

- Static testing - testing code as written.
- Manual testing - dev, env run the test.
- Unit testing - Step 0. Thinking about the outcome and writing that into a test. Unit is also testing one function.
- Inegration testing - Taking the function and making sure it works with the app and doesn't break anything
- End to End testing - Testing your user stories. It's going to use a browser and pretend like it's a user and go through your app
- A/B Testing - Testing 2 or more versions of your app and seeing what users like.
- Regression testing - When a bug comes up, creates a copy of the code and then we find a solution for it
